This repository was particularly crested for the iNeuBytes Virtual Internship Program [July_2024]. 
The task 1 that was assigned referred to implementing a Machine Learning Model for Classification problem based on (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/heart-disease-dataset) a heart disease dataset where models like KNN, Naive Bayes and Decision tree were applied.
The task 2 that was assigned referred to implementing a Machine Learning Model for Regression problem based on (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/pm25-airpolution-dataset) an pm2.5 air pollution dataset where models like Random forest and Ridge regression were applied.
The major task that was assigned referred to implementing a Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation for an E-Commerce Platform based on (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/online-retail-ecommerce-dataset) an online E-commerce Retail dataset where models like Decision tree and random forest regressor were applied.
